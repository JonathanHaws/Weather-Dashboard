# Weather Dashboard

## Descirption 
https://jonathanhaws.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/ This website will allow you to see weather conditions in different cities. Using the Open Weather API it fetches the closest city to a user's request in which it determines the geo cordinates. From there it can do a fetch request for the current weather and the forecast for the next 5 days. Finally it uses jQuery to dynamically generate html based on that data. Weather icons are provided by Open Weather API aswell.
