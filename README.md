# Weather Dashboard

## Description
https://jonathanhaws.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/ This website will allow you to see weather conditions in different cities. Using the Open Weather API it fetches the closest city to a user's request in which it determines the geo cordinates. From there it can do a fetch request for the current weather and the forecast for the next 5 days. Finally it uses jQuery to dynamically generate html based on that data. Weather icons are provided by Open Weather API aswell. Local storage is used to store search history and is dynamically displayed to make picking the correct city convient. The default city loaded will be the most recent location the user was on.
